Symfony Security Voters (free cookies!)
=======================================

.. seealso::

    Voters have been updated in Symfony 2.8! Check out our updated tutorial
    about them: `The new Voter Class`_.

Hey guys! It's getting a little colder in Michigan, Leanna and I are doing
a little bit of baking, and baking makes me think of security. Specifically
the kind of security that says: "no you can't eat my cookie because I baked it".
And it actually has use inside of our applications because a lot of times
we need to figure out whether the current user has access to edit, delete
or view something. It's because of this we've cooked up a delicious little
application which is going to show you one of my favorite and most underutilized
features in Symfony: security voters.

Today's Application: DeliciousCookie
------------------------------------

So I'll login using username ``ryan`` password ``cookie`` and basically we
only have one page in this app which shows us all of these cookies that Ryan
and Leanna have baked. Each of those has a "nom" button which allows me to
eat the cookie, shows me a nice message and deletes it from the database. Really
high-tech stuff.

The application is pretty straight forward: we have an ``AppBundle`` of course
and inside of there we have a single entity called ``DeliciousCookie``. The
most important thing about ``DeliciousCookie`` is that there's a ``bakerUsername``
property which stores who actually baked this cookie. To keep this application
simple I don't have a ``User`` entity so I'm just using a username string
there::

    // src/AppBundle/Entity/DeliciousCookie.php
    // ...

    /** @ORM\Entity */
    class DeliciousCookie
    {
        // ...

        /**
         * @ORM\Column()
         */
        private $flavor;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(name="baker_username")
         */
        private $bakerUsername;
        
        // ...
    }

Right now, anybody can eat any cookie no matter who baked it. But our goal
is to make it so that you can only eat cookies that you've baked. The
``CookieController`` holds the page that actually lists the cookies and then
there's one POST-only endpoint which handles actually deleting the cookie
in the database and setting that nice flash message::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/CookieController.php
    // ...

    class CookieController extends Controller
    {
        /** @Route("/cookies", name="cookie_list") */
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $cookies = $this->getDoctrine()
                ->getRepository('AppBundle:DeliciousCookie')
                ->findAll();

            return $this->render('Cookie/index.html.twig', array(
                'cookies' => $cookies,
            ));
        }

        /**
         * @Route("/cookies/nom/{id}", name="cookie_nom")
         * @Method("POST")
         */
        public function nomAction(Request $request, $id)
        {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
            $cookie = $em->getRepository('AppBundle:DeliciousCookie')
                ->find($id);

            // ...

            $em->remove($cookie);
            $em->flush();

            // some flash-setting stuff...

            return $this->redirect($url);
        }
    }

The only other interesting thing is ``security.yml``. We have two hard-coded
users: ``ryan`` and ``leanna``, and I also have an ``access_control`` which
requires login for everything under ``/cookies``, which is why we had to
login before we saw our cookie list. We take cookie security very seriously:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/security.yml
    security:
        # ...

        providers:
            in_memory:
                memory:
                    users:
                        ryan:  { password: cookie, roles: 'ROLE_COOKIE_ENJOYER' }
                        leanna: { password: cookie, roles: 'ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER' }


        firewalls:
            default:
                pattern: ^/
                anonymous: ~
                form_login: ~
                logout: ~

        access_control:
            - { path: ^/cookies, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY }

Preventing Access: The Easy Way
-------------------------------

Preventing me from eating a cookie baked by someone else is actually pretty
simple. And what we should do first is just put the logic into our controller.
So I'll do that here: if the baker's username does not equal the current user's 
username, we're going to throw that ``AccessDeniedException`` and say: "Hey
you didn't bake this!"::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/CookieController.php
    // ...

    public function nomAction(Request $request, $id)
    {
        $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
        $cookie = $em->getRepository('AppBundle:DeliciousCookie')
            ->find($id);

        // ...

        if ($cookie->getBakerUsername() != $this->getUser()->getUsername()) {
            throw $this->createAccessDeniedException(
                'You did not bake this delicious cookie!'
            );
        }
        // ...
    }

Now if we try to eat one of Leanna's cookies she catches us with a nice clear
message. And of course in the production environment, this would be your 403
error page.

.. tip::

    See `Error Pages`_ for how to customize your 404, 403 and 500 error
    pages in production.

So what's the problem with this? The problem is that we also need to go into 
our Twig template and repeat the logic there:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# app/Resources/views/Cookie/index.html.twig #}
    {# ... #}

    {% for cookie in cookies %}
        {# ... #}

        {% if cookie.bakerUsername == app.user.username %}
            <form action="{{ path('cookie_nom', {'id': cookie.id}) }}" method="POST">
                <button type="submit" class="btn">NOM! <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></i></button>
            </form>
        {% endif %}

        {# ... #}
    {% endfor %}

And when it comes to security logic, especially security logic that protects
cookies, we don't want to repeat it across your application. If you change
something later and forget to update part of your security, you're going
to have a big problem. But for now, I'll do it manually and we can see that
the nom button hides or shows based on which cookies I actually baked.

Creating a Voter
----------------

So the goal of a voter is to allow us to centralize that logic so we only
have it in one spot. I'll create a ``Security`` directory which is purely
for organization and then put a ``CookieVoter`` inside of it. I'm using Symfony 2.6
for this project, which comes with a fantastic new `AbstractVoter`_ class
which I'm going to use. If you're using Symfony 2.5 or lower, you can actually
`find this class on the internet`_ and just use it in your project today.
Just update the namespace to match your project and then extend it. This
class doesn't have any external dependencies so it's going to work just fine
in whatever Symfony version you have.

So I'll extend it and then use a really nice feature in PHPstorm to tell
me the three abstract methods that I need to fill in::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    namespace AppBundle\Security;

    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\Voter\AbstractVoter;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;

    class CookieVoter extends AbstractVoter
    {
        protected function getSupportedClasses()
        {
            // todo
        }

        protected function getSupportedAttributes()
        {
            // todo
        }

        protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
        {
            // todo
        }
    }

But What does a Voter Do?
-------------------------

So let me back up because I haven't actually told you what these voters do.
First let me show you how I want our code to look when we're finished. Instead
of doing the logic manually I'm going to use the ``isGranted`` function, pass
it a  string: ``NOM`` which is something I'm making up -- you'll see why
it's important in a second -- and then pass the ``$cookie`` object as the
second argument to  ``isGranted``::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/CookieController.php
    // ...

    public function nomAction(Request $request, $id)
    {
        $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
        $cookie = $em->getRepository('AppBundle:DeliciousCookie')
            ->find($id);

        // ...

        if (!$this->isGranted('NOM', $cookie)) {
            throw $this->createAccessDeniedException(
                'You did not bake this delicious cookie!'
            );
        }
        // ...
    }    

The ``isGranted`` shortcut is new to 2.6 but all it does is go out to the 
``security.context`` service and call ``isGranted`` on it. So this is exactly
what you're using in earlier projects. If you don't have the shortcut method
just  go out to the ``security.context`` service manually.

Behind the scenes, whenever you use the ``isGranted`` function, Symfony calls
out to a bunch of voters and asks each of them if they can figure out whether
or not we should have access. For example, whenever you pass ``ROLE_SOMETHING``
to ```isGranted``` like ```ROLE_USER``, there's a ``RoleVoter``` class which
tries to figure out whether the current user has whatever role you're asking
about.

What most people don't realize is that you can invent these strings. So in
this case I'm just inventing ``NOM`` and we're going to add a new voter into
that system that says: "Hey Symfony! Whenever the ``NOM`` attribute is passed
to ``isGranted``, call me!" To get that to work we just need to fill in the
``getSupportedClasses`` and the ``getSupportedAttributes`` functions.

Filling in CookieVoter
----------------------

First, in ``getSupportedClasses``, were going to return the ``DeliciousCookie``
class  string::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function getSupportedClasses()
    {
        return array('AppBundle\Entity\DeliciousCookie');
    }

This tells Symfony that when we pass a ``DeliciousCookie`` object to ``isGranted``,
our voter should be called. We'll do the same thing in ``getSupportedAttributes``
and we'll return an array with the ``NOM`` string::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function getSupportedAttributes()
    {
        return array('NOM');
    }

This tells Symfony that when we pass ``NOM`` to ``isGranted`` that *our*
voter should be called. Whenever both of these functions return ``true``,
the ```isGranted``` function at the bottom of this class is going to be called. 

For now I'll just use the glorious ``var_dump`` to print the attribute object
and  user and I'm going to put a die after that::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        var_dump($attribute, $object, $user);die;
    }

Registering and Tagging your Voter
----------------------------------

At this point, other than the crazy debug code I have at the bottom, our
voter class is ready to go. But Symfony is not going to automatically find
it. To tell Symfony about our new voter we're going to need to register it
as a service and give it a special tag.

I have an ``app/config/services.yml`` file which I'm importing from my ``config.yml``
file, so we'll put the service there:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/services.yml
    services:
        app_cookie_voter:
            class: AppBundle\Security\CookieVoter
            tags:
                - { name: security.voter }

The name doesn't matter but try to keep it relatively short. And the autocompleting
I'm getting is from the nice `Symfony2 plugin for PHPStorm`_. Our class
doesn't have any constructor arguments yet so I'm just leaving that key off.

The really important part is ``tags``. You need to add one tag whose name
is ``security.voter``. This is like raising our hand for our voter and saying:
"Hey Symfony, whenever somebody calls ``isGranted`` I want *our* voter to
actually be called."

So we have the voter, we have the service with the tag so let's try it out!
When we refresh... Bam! We see things dumped out: proof that our voter is
being called.

Adding your Cookie-Protecting Biz Logic
---------------------------------------

Now here's where things get really really cool. Now in theory because of
my ``access_control``, this voter should never be called unless the user
is logged in. But just in case it is let's use ``is_object`` to check to
see if the  user is actually logged in::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        if (!is_object($user)) {
            return false;
        }

        // ... todo
    }

Remember we need to do this because in Symfony 2 if you're anonymous the
user is actually set to a string. From here it's pure business logic: if
the Baker's username equals the user's username let's give them access.
Otherwise let's not give them access::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        if (!is_object($user)) {
            return false;
        }

        if ($object->getBakerUsername() == $user->getUsername()) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

So let's refresh the "nom" request ... and it works! We're logged in as Ryan
and we are actually nomming a Ryan cookie so this make sense. Remember the
goal of this was to centralize our logic. So now we can go into our Twig
template and do the exact same thing there. We'll use the ``is_granted``
function, pass it nom and pass it the ``cookie`` object:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# app/Resources/views/Cookie/index.html.twig #}
    {# ... #}

    {% for cookie in cookies %}
        {# ... #}

        {% if is_granted('NOM', cookie) %}
            <form action="{{ path('cookie_nom', {'id': cookie.id}) }}" method="POST">
                <button type="submit" class="btn">NOM! <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></i></button>
            </form>
        {% endif %}

        {# ... #}
    {% endfor %}

And as you might expect, when we refresh, we see the exact same results as
before except everything is pulling from that central voter. 

Giving a ``ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER`` User Special Access
----------------------------------------------------

Now with everything centralized I want to make things a little bit more 
difficult. In ``security.yml`` I've given the ``leanna`` user a special role
called ``ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/security.yml
    security:
        # ...

        providers:
            in_memory:
                memory:
                    users:
                        ryan:  { password: cookie, roles: 'ROLE_COOKIE_ENJOYER' }
                        leanna: { password: cookie, roles: 'ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER' }

If you have this role, I want to make it so you can eat any cookie even if
you didn't bake it. Seems like a jerk thing to do but let's try it out.

To do this, we basically want to call the ``isGranted`` function on the security
system from inside of our voter. Now, out-of-the-box we don't have access
to do this, so we're going to need to do a little bit of dependency injection.
If you're thinking that we'll inject the ``security.context``, you're 
basically right. The only issue is that because we're inside of the security 
system if we try to inject the security system into here we're going to get a 
circular dependency. Instead, I'm going to inject the entire container, which, 
yes is typically a bad practice, but in this case we can't avoid it and it's
not going to kill us::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...
    
    class CookieVoter extends AbstractVoter
    {
        private $container;

        public function __construct(ContainerInterface $container)
        {
            $this->container = $container;
        }
        
        // ...
    }

Head back to ``services.yml`` add an arguments key now that we have a
``__construct`` function and use ``@service_container`` to inject the entire
container:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/services.yml
    services:
        app_cookie_voter:
            class: AppBundle\Security\CookieVoter
            arguments: ["@service_container"]
            tags:
                - { name: security.voter }

Back down in ``isGranted`` we can easily add the logic we need::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        if (!is_object($user)) {
            return false;
        }

        // in 2.5 and earlier, use this:
        // $this->container->get('security.context');
        // security.context exists in 2.6, but is deprecated
        $authChecker = $this->container->get('security.authorization_checker');

        if ($authChecker->isGranted('ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER')) {
            return true;
        }

        if ($object->getBakerUsername() == $user->getUsername()) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

Now I'm using Symfony 2.6 which gives us a brand-new service called ``security.authorization_checker``.
This is actually a new service for Symfony 2.6. Before it was known as
``security.context``. Now don't worry because ``security.context`` still
exists and will still exist until Symfony 3.0. So if you're on Symfony 2.6
use the new service name. If you're on 2.5 or earlier just use ``security.context``.
The nice thing is that both of them have the same ``isGranted`` function
on it which we can use now to check to see if the user has the ``ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER``
role. If they do, let's give them access.

When we try it out there's no difference and that's a good thing. I'm logged
in as ``ryan`` so I don't actually have this role. So I'll logout. Let's
login as ``leanna``, password ``cookie``, and.....COOKIES FOR EVERYBODY! 

Adding Multiple Actions (NOM, DONATE) to 1 Voter
------------------------------------------------

I want to do one more crazy thing. Let's pretend like we want to be able 
to donate our cookies to friends. Now I know that's crazy why would you donate 
cookies to other people? But let's just try it out. I don't actually have the 
logic for this but that's okay. Let's go into ``index.html.twig`` and add
a link for this. We're just going to see if we can get the link to hide and
show correctly:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# app/Resources/views/Cookie/index.html.twig #}
    {# ... #}

    {% for cookie in cookies %}
        {# ... #}

        <td>
            {% if is_granted('DONATE', cookie) %}
                <a href="">Donate</a>
            {% endif %}
        </td>

        {# ... #}
    {% endfor %}    

Just like before I'm inventing this ``DONATE`` string. If we don't do anything
else and refresh, we'll actually see that the link doesn't show up. If no
voters vote on our attribute, then by default it's going to return false.
Now why is our voter not voting on it? Because of the ``getSupportedAttributes``
function. 

Let's update that to return true for both ``NOM`` and ``DONUT``...I mean
``DONATE``::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...

    protected function getSupportedAttributes()
    {
        return array('NOM', 'DONATE');
    }

Now ``isGranted`` is going to be handling two different attributes, ``NOM``
and ``DONATE``. This is the perfect situation for everyone's beloved switch 
case statement. So let's set that up, and we have two cases one for ``NOM``
and one for ``DONATE``. And the logic for ``NOM`` is exactly what we had before
so I'll just copy that, paste that up and if it doesn't get into either those
if statements we'll return false::

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        if (!is_object($user)) {
            return false;
        }

        $authChecker = $this->container->get('security.authorization_checker');

        switch ($attribute) {
            case 'NOM':
                if ($authChecker->isGranted('ROLE_COOKIE_MONSTER')) {
                    return true;
                }

                if ($object->getBakerUsername() == $user->getUsername()) {
                    return true;
                }

                return false;
            case 'DONATE':
                // todo ...
        }

        return false;
    }

For the ``DONATE`` case, again, we can do literally anything we want to inside
of this. If we want to go out and make crazy database queries to figure out 
something we can do that. In our case since chocolate cookies are the most 
delicious, let's only give away cookies that aren't chocolate. So, for my crazy 
business logic I'm just going to see if the word chocolate appears in the name 
of the cookie. If it does I'm not going to give it away. But if it doesn't you 
can have it::


    switch ($attribute) {
        case 'NOM':
            // ...
        case 'DONATE':
            return stripos($object->getFlavor(), 'chocolate') === false;
    }

At the bottom of this function, I still have this false here. This should
technically never get hit. Even if we pass something other than ``NOM`` or 
``DONATE`` to ``isGranted`` Symfony is not going to call our voter because
of the  ``getSupportedAttributes``. 

So, you can put anything down here I like to throw an exception just incase 
something insane happens. But you're going to be fine either way::

    protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
    {
        // ...

        switch ($attribute) {
            // ...
        }

        throw new \LogicException('How did we get here!?');
    }

Cool, let's see which cookies we can giveaway. This time we see the donate
link only next to the cookies that aren't chocolate. That's perfect.

Let's use some Constants
------------------------

Now, some of you may be thinking that I'm crazy for having these strings
like ``NOM`` and ``DONATE`` all over my application. And actually, I agree
with you. Normally whenever I have a naked string somewhere I make it a constant
instead. So in this case I'll create two constants: ``ATTRIBUTE_NOM`` and
``ATTRIBUTE_DONATE``::

    // src/AppBundle/Security/CookieVoter.php
    // ...
    
    class CookieVoter extends AbstractVoter
    {
        const ATTRIBUTE_NOM = 'NOM';
        const ATTRIBUTE_DONATE = 'DONATE';
        
        // ...
        
        protected function getSupportedAttributes()
        {
            return array(self::ATTRIBUTE_NOM, self::ATTRIBUTE_DONATE);
        }
        
        // ...
        
        protected function isGranted($attribute, $object, $user = null)
        {
            // ...

            switch ($attribute) {
                case self::ATTRIBUTE_NOM:
                    // ...
                case self::ATTRIBUTE_DONATE:
                    // ...
            }

            throw new \LogicException('How did we get here!?');
        }
    }

Then we can use these inside of ``getSupportedAttributes`` and later we can
use it inside of the ``isGranted`` function. This helps out with typos but
it also  allows us, if we want to, to put some PHP documentation above those
constants so  future us can come and read what nom and donate actually mean.

We can also go into our ``CookieController`` and use the constant there::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/CookieController.php
    // ...
    
    if (!$this->isGranted(CookieVoter::ATTRIBUTE_NOM, $cookie)) {
        throw $this->createAccessDeniedException(
            'You did not bake this delicious cookie!'
        );
    }

And yes  we can also use the constants inside of the twig template with twig's
``constant()`` function, but honestly it's kind of ugly so for me I just
keep the strings here. 

Go Security Voters Go!
----------------------

So security voters are all about solving that case when you need figure out
if a user has access to do something to a specific object. They help to keep
your template logic and your controller logic really simple and they're
one of my favorite features. So try them out and let me know what you think. 

Symfony also has an ACL system but it's incredibly complex and I only recommend
that you use it if you have really complex authorization requirements.
If you can somehow write a few lines of code to figure out if a user has
access to do something do that in a voter don't worry about ACL.

Alright see you guys next time!
